# Tempo Run

A web application which generates a playlist of songs based on the user's running pace. 

After logging into their Spotify account, the user can choose a genre or their own saved tracks, and the app will provide songs with tempos that match their desired running pace. The user can then save that playlist directly in their Spotify account.

## Motivation
